# Whats this?
my attempt at creating a somewhat useful(obviously not) kubernetes operator using kubebuilder 

## Ok? So what does it do ?
This operator watches for a service defined in the manifest and sends a discord message when the service is created(and possibly destroyed).

:warning: this is still under development so install at your own risk.
